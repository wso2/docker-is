### Changed
- Changed the folders to which configuration files with new changes to be copied are mounted. 
Originally this was <br>`wso2-server-volume` in general and for Kubernetes, the folder to which
ConfigMap volumes were to be mounted was `kubernetes-volumes`. But with this release, there will not be
any platform specific folders for mounting configuration files. Instead, we are introducing a single folder 
for this purpose by the name, `wso2-config-volume`. 

- Changed the folder to which any other non-configuration type artifacts to be copied are mounted.
Originally this was `wso2-server-volume`. But with this release, this is changed to `wso2-artifact-volume`.

### Compatibility with `wso2/kubernetes-is` releases
- If you are to use images built using this release with the latest v5.6.0.1 Kubernetes release, please do change
your deployment mount paths appropriately to match above folder changes.
