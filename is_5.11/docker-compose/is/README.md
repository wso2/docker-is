# Docker Compose resources for a WSO2 Identity Server deployment

## Prerequisites

 * Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)
   and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose) in order to run the steps provided in following Quick start guide. <br><br>
 * In order to use Docker images with [WSO2 Updates](https://wso2.com/updates), you need an active [WSO2 Subscription](https://wso2.com/subscription).
   Otherwise, you can proceed with Docker images available at [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/wso2/), which are created using GA releases.<br><br>
 * If you wish to run the Docker Compose setup using Docker images built locally, build Docker images using Docker resources available from [here](../../dockerfiles/)
   and remove the `docker.wso2.com/` prefix from the `image` name in the `docker-compose.yml`. <br><br>
   
## How to deploy

  1. Clone WSO2 Identity Server Docker git repository.
  
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/wso2/docker-is
     ```
     
     > If you are to try out an already released zip of this repo, please ignore this 1st step.

  2. Switch to the `docker-compose/is` folder.
  
     ```
     cd [docker-is]/docker-compose/is
     ```
     
     > If you are to try out an already released zip of this repo, please ignore this 2nd step also. 
      Instead, extract the zip file and directly browse to `docker-is-<released-version-here>/docker-compose/is` folder. 
     
     > If you want to try out an already released tag, after executing 2nd step, checkout the relevant tag, 
      i.e. for example: git checkout tags/v5.11.0.1 and continue below steps.

  3. Execute following Docker Compose command to start the deployment.
  
     ```
     docker-compose up
     ```
     
  4. Access Management Console, My Account and Console applications via a web browser.

     ```
     For Identity Server Management Console - https://localhost:9443/carbon
     For Identity Server My Account - https://localhost:9443/myaccount
     For Identity Server Console - https://localhost:9443/console
     ```
